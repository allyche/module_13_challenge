# Module 13 Challenge

In this challenge, I was asked to help Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm, to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by the company.

The CSV file provided more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

I'm going to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier model to make the prediction.

## Key Tasks
1. Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
2. Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model Using a Neural Network
3. Optimize the Neural Network Model

## Installation Guide
Before running the application first install and import the following library & dependencies:

1. import pandas as pd
2. from pathlib import Path
3. import tensorflow as tf
4. from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
5. from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
6. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
7. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
